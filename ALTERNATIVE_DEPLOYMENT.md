# Alternative Deployment Options

Since Vercel is having issues with our Python Flask app, here are two reliable alternatives:

## Option 1: Railway (Recommended)

Railway is excellent for Python apps and very similar to Vercel.

### Steps:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `case` repository
5. Railway will auto-detect it's a Python app
6. Add environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your API key
   - `SECRET_KEY`: Your secret key
7. Deploy!

### Benefits:
- ✅ Better Python support
- ✅ Automatic deployments from GitHub
- ✅ Free tier available
- ✅ Similar to Vercel workflow

## Option 2: Render

Another excellent platform for Python apps.

### Steps:
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repo
5. Configure:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `python web_app.py`
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy!

## Why These Work Better:

- **Railway & Render** are designed specifically for full-stack apps
- **Better Python runtime support**
- **More predictable deployment process**
- **Better debugging tools**

## Current Vercel Issue:

The `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` error suggests Vercel's serverless functions aren't properly handling our Flask app, even in the most minimal form. This is a known issue with some Python applications on Vercel.

## Recommendation:

**Try Railway first** - it's the most similar to your current Vercel workflow and handles Python Flask apps excellently.
